							<div>
								<p style="color:white;">Onnosheba started in 2014, supplying only 20 units of packaged yellow rice “Khichuri” per day and now serves around 500 packets and employs 24 employees and has expanded to two outlets in 2016 and looking to expand another two outlets in 2017. There is an estimated potential demand for over 200,000 meals per day for lower income group in garment industry and schools in Chittagong urban area.</p>
								<p style="color:white;">We have also planned to start a mega kitchen having capacity of 10,000 meals per day to tap into this market. Large-scale investment is required for construction of mega kitchen. Increased production will reduce per unit fixed cost through more efficient supply chain and due to scale economics. Onnosheba also plans to introduce a mass package food for working people in future. Funding of the above is expected from shareholders and financing companies.</p>
